This autocorrect project takes in a user-inputted string and gives spelling 
suggestions. In the UI, the autocorrect can also implement these suggestions 
at the user's request. 

The autocorrect algorithm being used is called SymSpell, which stores
precalculated deletes and checks them against deletes of the user's string.

Run cinder-app-main to use the autocorrect UI.
