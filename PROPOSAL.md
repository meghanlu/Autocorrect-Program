I want to create a spelling program that provides spelling corrections for a user-inputted string. This program would have a clean, intuitive user interface where words typed and feedback would appear.

I don't have too much background knowledge for this project, but I am motivated to learn more about using APIs (will possibly use a dictionary API), and I am curious about natural language processing. While this isn't exactly advanced NLP, I think it's a good starting place where I can explore the nuances of the English language.

For week 1, I want to figure out and start implementing the autocorrect feature. While I have a few ideas about how to achieve this, I will definitely need to spend time researching. Thus, I will give myself until the end of week 2 to fully implement the autocorrect algorithm/logic. By the end of week 3, I would like to have the user interface done using Cinder.

If I have extra time, I could implement simple grammar checking or improve the design of my UI.
