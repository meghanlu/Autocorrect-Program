I want to create a spelling program that provides spelling corrections for a user-inputted string. 
This program would have a clean, intuitive user interface where words typed and feedback would appear.

I don't have too much background knowledge for this project, but I am motivated to learn more about using APIs 
(will possibly use a dictionary API), and I am curious about natural language processing. 
While this isn't exactly advanced NLP, 
I think it's a good starting place where I can explore the nuances of the English language.

(Algorithms from https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jah473/java/autocorrect/tutorials/autocorrect.html)
There are 3 main autocorrect algorithms:
-Autocomplete
-Whitespace
-Levenshtein Edit Distance

For week 1, I want to set up the structure for the program (i.e. taking in a string and checking each word) and
implement the spellcheck feature (i.e. checking each word to see if it is a legitimate word). 
I will also implement the autocomplete and whitespace algorithms for the autocorrect feature.
For week 2, I want to implement the Levenshtein Edit Distance(the most complicated) 
autocorrect algorithm.
By the end of week 3, I want to connect everything to a user interface on Cinder.

If I have extra time, I could implement simple grammar checking or improve the design of my UI.
